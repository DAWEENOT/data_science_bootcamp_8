# Machine Learning (ML)

## Summary in Bootcamp [question from mini quiz ML final]
Question: เรียน ML จบแล้วเป็นยังไงบ้าง สรุปไอเดียสำคัญที่ได้จาก sprint นี้ 3-5 ข้อ เป็ร bullet point ได้นะครับ

I have no idea about machine learning before I learned. After that, I got some points about how different ML and STAT are.

- The difference ML and STAT is STAT you need to explain the relationship between x and y, If x changes at one point how would it change in y like that. ML just wants to prediction the model or dataset that we split, train, test, and scoring or evaluation.
- ML is the train and test model that we want to predict in your project.
- The hardest of ML is you need to understand your dataset before you prepare your dataset and after that, you can train, test, and split your dataset.
- The most important that I got this is they is no the best model, but It has only one that fit your data.
- The most basic model that use in ML is regression and decision tree because it can explanation to other people what we want to they know.
