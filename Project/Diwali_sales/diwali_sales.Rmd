# Introduction

Hi, my name is Dhanachote. I'm working on a mini-project to analyze and practice the R language, build my data visualization skills, and create a report using Rmarkdown. For this project, I'm using the 'Diwali Sales' dataset sourced from Kaggle, which you can find at the link below. Therefore, I cleaned the dataset in Excel before importing it into R programming.

    - Question 3: Which state has the highest total customer purchase amount?
    - Question 4 : State / Zone
        - Question 4.1: Count the number of orders for each zone and calculate the average order size for each zone.
        - Question 4.2: Calculate the total number of orders across all zones.
        - Question 4.3: For each zone, identify the product category with the highest number of orders.
        - Question 4.4: Identify the product category with the highest total sales amount in the each zone.
    - Question 5: Generation
        - Question 5.1: Which customer has spent the most money? To which generation do they belong?

### Part I Questions and Data Visualization

In this part, I asking a serveral questions to understanding in the dataset. I use library such as `tidyverse` ,`readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `caret` before query the dataset.

### Install packages and download library

```{r library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Library
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
```

#### Import dataset from `.csv`
```{r warning=FALSE}
## import read.csv()

diwali_sales <- tibble(read.csv("Diwali_Sales_Data_main.csv"))

```

#### Check NA 
```{r warning=FALSE}
## check NA

diwali_sales %>%
  complete.cases()%>%
  mean()
```

> I use `complete.cases()` to check for missing values and then use `mean()` to calculate the logical mean (TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0). If the mean value is 0, it means that the dataset is complete and has no missing values. 

***


> **Tip**: You can check logical values by using the `as.logical()` function. For example, `as.logical(0)` evaluates to FALSE, while 1 evaluates to TRUE.

#### **Prepare the dataset**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## select column

ds_cl <- diwali_sales %>%
  select(User_ID,
         Cust_name,
         Product_ID,
         Product_Category,
         Gender,
         Age,
         Marital_Status,
         State,
         Zone,
         Occupation,
         Orders,
         Amount) %>%
  drop_na()
```

***

### Question 1: What is the most popular product category during Diwali sales?
```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
q1 <- diwali_sales %>%
  group_by(Product_Category) %>%
  summarise(Total_amount = sum(Orders * Amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_amount)) %>%
  head(5)

print(q1)

message("The most product category total amount is: ", 
        head(q1$Product_Category,1),
        " " ,
        "and",
        " ",
        "The total amount is: $ ",
        head(q1$Total_amount,1))
```




##### **Plot 1:**
```{r warning=FALSE}
ds_cl %>%
  group_by(Product_Category) %>%
  summarise(
    total_amount = sum(Amount * Orders)
  ) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_amount)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Product_Category, -total_amount), total_amount, fill = Product_Category)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Top Five Product Category",
    x = "Product Category",
    y = "Total Amount",
    caption = "Source: Kaggle Diwali Sales Dataset"
  )
```


***

### Question 2: Which customer has the highest total purchase amount?
```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
## Question2 : Who is the most spending amount

q2 <- diwali_sales %>%
  group_by(Cust_name) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_amount = sum(Orders * Amount)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_amount)) %>%
  head(5)

print(q2)
message(head(q2$Cust_name,1),
        " ",
        "is the most spending amount in $ ",
        head(q2$Total_amount,1),
        " product category")
```

##### **Plot 2**
```{r warning=FALSE}

  )
```

***

### Question 3: Which state has the highest total customer purchase amount?
```{r}
q3 <- diwali_sales%>%
    select(Cust_name,
           Gender,
           State,
           Zone,
           Orders,
           Amount) %>%

    head(10)

print(q3)
message("Which state is the most user spending is: ",
        head(q3$State,1))
```
***

### Question 4 : State / Zone

> In this question, I provided a chart that explains which state has the highest total amount before starting the questions.

```{r}
## Plot 4: Relationship with State and Amount

ds_cl %>%
  group_by(State) %>%

```



#### **Question 4.1**: Count the number of orders for each zone and calculate the average order size for each zone.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# count zone
diwali_sales %>%
  count(Zone)
```

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

  arrange(desc(total_avg_orders))
```


#### **Question 4.2**: Calculate the total number of orders across all zones.
```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

### Question 5: Generation
 Since the dataset does not have a Generation column, I need to create one.
```{r}
## create generation table

diwali_sales_gen <- diwali_sales %>%
                select(User_ID,
                       Cust_name,

                       Marital_Status,
                       Marital_Status,
                       State,
                       Zone,
                       Occupation,
                       Product_Category,

### Summary 

In summary, the most prominent product category in the Diwali Sales dataset is food. The dataset shows that in the state of Uttar Pradesh, there are a lot of customers buying during Diwali. In terms of zones, the Central zone has the highest total amount. Lastly, the most common customer age range is 26-35, representing Generation Z. By the way, I've noticed that females spend more than males in this dataset.

## **Part II**: Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learing

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building computer systems that learn from data.

#### **Before delving into machine learning.**

I am using machine learning to predict the amount of sales during Diwali. In this section, I have broken down the topic to make it understandable for everyone, demonstrating how I code by following these steps:

- Install package
- Import dataset
- Prepare data
- Split data
- Train & Test data
- Scoring
- Evaluate model

***
