Hi, my name is Dhanachote. I’m working on a mini-project to analyze and practice the R language, build
my data visualization skills, and create a report using Rmarkdown. For this project, I’m using the ‘Diwali
Sales’ dataset sourced from Kaggle, which you can find at the link below. Therefore, I cleaned the dataset
in Excel before importing it into R programming.
