## Introduction myself
Actually, you might be wondering, after seeing my resume, that I did not directly graduate in IT or Economic Management. 
I developed an interest in data science and analysis a year ago, and I earned a certificate from a data science bootcamp by Datarockie (a 6-month program) on 2023-11-06. 
I enjoy learning and am eager to enhance my skills and business mindset. 
Even though my coding and analytical skills may not be as advanced as those with experience in eCommerce, IT, DA, and DE, I consider myself a generalist. 
While I may not be the best, I am versatile and can handle various tasks while gaining knowledge.
