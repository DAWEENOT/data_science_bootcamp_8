## Introduction myself

Hello, my name is Dhanachote W., and I graduated from Assumption University with a BBA, majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management. Although I studied Data Science and Data Analysis since 2022 through platforms like Data Camp, Coursera, and W3Schools, it's important to note that merely enrolling in a subject doesn't always reflect true proficiency. Nevertheless, my enthusiasm for programming languages drives my aspirations for my next career.

You might be curious, upon reviewing my resume, about my direct graduation in IT or Economic Management. Despite my background, I developed a keen interest in data science and analysis a year ago. Recently, I completed a 6-month data science bootcamp with Datarockie, earning a certificate on 2023-11-06. I am passionate about continuous learning and eager to improve my skills and business mindset.

While my coding and analytical skills may not match those with extensive experience in eCommerce, IT, DA, and DE, I consider myself a generalist. Although not the best, I am versatile and can handle various tasks while actively gaining knowledge.

Finally, my resume includes a Linktree QR code that connects to files such as my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, and certificates. Feel free to explore my journey and accomplishments through these resources.
